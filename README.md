# A shell in C

## Intro

This is a simple shell/terminal beginner project (I suppose) I'm writing in C. The reason I'm using the C languge is that It's the language I'm most experienced with as a begginer and I'm still yet not comfortable in C++ and in the process of learning it. I'm planning this to grow with my learning process. Without any further personal talking let's go into this.  

## Motivation 

This is just a recommended project from [Project Based Learning](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning) that I found interesting and simple enough for me and can add to my software development growth, and you can find the article [here](https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/).

Just for pionting out, I'm not following the instructions of the online article. This is from my figuring out.
